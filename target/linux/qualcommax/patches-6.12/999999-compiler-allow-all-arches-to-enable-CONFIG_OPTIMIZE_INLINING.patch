+	bool "Allow compiler to uninline functions marked 'inline'"
+	help
+	  This option determines if the kernel forces gcc to inline the functions
+	  developers have marked 'inline'. Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to
+	  do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of
+	  compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and
+	  enabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully
+	  this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc 4.x and above to make the
+	  decision will become the default in the future. Until then this option
+	  is there to test gcc for this.
